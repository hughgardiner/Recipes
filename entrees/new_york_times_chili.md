- 12 ounces (1 1/2 cups) pilsner beer, such as Modelo Especial
- 1 (14-ounce) can diced or crushed tomatoes in juice
- ¼ cup cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons beef stock bouillon paste, such as Better Than Bouillon
- 1 ½ teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 (14-ounce) cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed

## Directions
1. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add the onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and translucent, about 8 minutes. 
2. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the beef and garlic, season with salt and cook, breaking the beef into crumbles with a spatula, until the beef has lost its pink color, 8 to 10 minutes. 
3. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until slightly darkened and caramelized, about 1 minute. 
4. Stir in all the spices and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
5. Add the beer and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan.
6. Transfer the beef mixture into a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker. 
7. Stir in the tomatoes, vinegar, maple syrup, soy sauce, beef bouillon paste, cocoa, beans and 1/2 cup water. 
8. Cover and cook on low for at least 4 hours and up to 6 hours. (The chili can hold well on warm for an additional 2 hours.)
9. When ready to serve, stir in the Worcestershire sauce. If the chili is too thick, stir in a bit of water until the texture is to your liking. Season to taste with salt. Serve in bowls and pass the toppings at the table
